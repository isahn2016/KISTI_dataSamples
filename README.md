Welcome!

This site was created for the purpose of sharing sample data for infectious disease research between KISTI and UI. The descriptions for each dataset are as follows:

1. sample01_population_movement:

This dataset contains monthly population movement data between Indonesia and South Korea via passenger flights. The sample data is limited to cases where the exchange volume of travelers between the two countries is in the top 10%. Once a standard agreement for data sharing between the two countries is established, we plan to upload the full dataset. Each traveler's data is organized in CSV files, and for better understanding, graphs showing the exchange volume based on the CSV files are provided in the graph folder.

2. sample02_KDCA_surveillance:
   
This dataset includes standardized weekly surveillance data by disease group provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). It contains both comprehensive and sample surveillance data, with the comprehensive surveillance including information by major cities or provinces in South Korea. Each disease surveillance dataset is organized in CSV files, and for better understanding, graphs showing the disease occurrence patterns based on the CSV files are provided in the graph folder.

3. sample03_KDCA_COVID19:

This dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases by major cities and provinces in South Korea from 2020 to May 2023, provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The uploaded CSV files contain standardized weekly data based on raw data provided by the South Korean government. Each surveillance dataset is organized in CSV files, and for better understanding, graphs showing the disease occurrence patterns based on the CSV files are provided in the graph folder.

4. sample04_Korea_weather:

This dataset contains temperature and humidity data for major cities in South Korea, provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The data was collected via API and standardized by week and city, then organized into CSV files.
